		mBank. Powered by you It is our vision of a bank of the future
			focused on clients' needs and able to interpret and meet them
			accurately. We have decided to combine our forces under the mBank
			brand, as it enjoys the strongest recognition of all members of the
			Group and provides its services to millions of clients in Poland, the
			Czech Republic and Slovakia. So far mBank has been associated mainly
			with innovative solutions in electronic banking but we want the brand
			to become common to all of our clients and therefore we have decided
			to change it. In 2013, we presented the new values and image of
			mBank. Today, under the mBank logo, which has different colours
			depending on the type of the offer, our goal is to build the most
			client-friendly bank in Poland. A bank that will be close to clients
			and their needs.

		Why are we changing? BRE Bank was founded over 27 years ago. It
			was among the pioneers in the field of corporate banking in Poland.
			Over the years BRE Bank developed its experience in rendering
			services to corporate clients. In 1996, the Bank started to offer a
			wider range of products by launching private banking services.
			Following this, in 2000, BRE Bank began to provide services to retail
			clients. mBank, offering its services only on the Internet, was
			launched first. Then it was joined by MultiBank, representing the
			traditional model of banking.
			</p>
		<p>
		BRE Bank offered its services under four brands characterized
			by different products and communication for 17 years in Poland. Six
			years ago it entered the Czech and Slovak markets and is still
			present in these countries. In 2013, the organisation that had so far
			provided its services to different groups of clients, ranging from
			young people, micro-entrepreneurs, affluent clients to the biggest
			corporations, decided to stress the universal nature of its business
			by adopting one common brand - mBank. Thus, one of the biggest banks
			in Poland - mBank S.A. - started a new chapter in its history on 25
			November 2013 combining the multiannual experience of all the four
			brands. Along with rebranding, the visual identification will also be
			refreshed. Our branches will gain a more modern look. Eventually, the
			bank’s retail and corporate branches will be merged for the
			convenience of clients.</p>
		<p>
		After changing the bank's name, the following will remain the
			same: bank account numbers, operating procedures and functions of the
			transactional system, telephone numbers and addresses of corporate
			branches and retail outlets, channels of communication with advisers
			and availability of advisers for clients, all arrangements included
			in the agreements concluded so far by BRE Bank (no need to sign other
			documents).
			</p>
		<p>
		Each year, mBank (previously operating as MultiBank, BRE Bank
			and BRE Private Banking) is awarded numerous distinctions for the
			quality of services and products offered. We are the winners of
			marketing competitions and climb the podium defeating not only
			competitors from Poland but also from abroad. Below is a small sample
			of what mBank has managed to achieve with the support of its clients
			during its 27-year long presence on the Polish market.
